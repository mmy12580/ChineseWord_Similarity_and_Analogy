# ChineseWord_Similarity_and_Analogy
A simple project for evaluating Chinese word similarity and analogy from pre-trained embeddings.

## Environment:
````
python3.6.5
````

## Dependency
````
gensim==3.7.3
numpy==1.16.4
scipy==1.3.0
````

## Quick Usage:
````
1. Download any Chinese Embedding file e.g glove, word2vec, fasttext
2. chmod a+x test.sh
3. ./test.sh
````

## Note

Feel free to change any test file. However, you might need to keep the same format as pre-designed test files in `test_data`.
